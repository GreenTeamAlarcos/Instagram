## Abstract
(1) Background: The internet’s widespread use has made social media platforms (SMPs) an integral part of everyday life, transforming global communication and information sharing. Instagram, one of the leading SMPs, has 500 million daily users and offers various functionalities, such as stories and posts. However, the environmental impact of using these platforms remains largely unexplored.
(2) Methods: Using the FEETINGS framework, this paper investigates the energy consumption of Instagram by conducting measurement studies of various functionalities on both tablets and PCs.
(3) Results: The study found significant differences in energy consumption across different Instagram features. Sharing videos in stories and reels was identified as one of the most energy-intensive activities, and device choice was found to influence overall energy consumption, with PCs consuming more energy than tablets. 
(4) Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of optimising Instagram use for greater energy efficiency. Prioritising energy-efficient features and considering device choice can mitigate environmental impact and promote sustainable digital practices


## What is this?

This repository includes the resulting empirical results and some samples of the energy records obtained from the hardware measurement instrument used in the study.


## How is structured?

This folder contains three main folders: empirical results, resources and sample logs.


## Empirical Results Folder

The empirical results folder includes all the information on the analysis of the energy consumption of Instagram. The basic terminology used is as follows:
- An entity class corresponds to a Instagram. 
- The test case is each specific funcionality of Instagram.
- Measurement is each of the executions of a testcase.


### Report Folder
The report folder contains 225 Excel files containing the analysis data. One for each test case named `<EntityClass>@<Algorithm>`. It also contains two files "testcases_total" and "versions_total" with the summary of the test case and version information respectively.
As an example, the following images show the information of a test case.

The first image shows all the information of a measurement.

The second image shows all the information of a test case.

To facilitate the comparison of information, the file "testcases_total" contains one sheet for each statistical value of all test cases. These statistical values are:
Consumption average without baseline, Consumption median without baseline, Consumption average (with baseline), Consumption median (with baseline), Baseline, Power min, Power average without baseline, Power average (with baseline), Power median without baseline, Power median (with baseline), Trimmed mean to 20%, Winsorized mean to 20%, Geometric mean, Mean standard deviation, Mean variance, Standard deviation among measurments and Variance among measurments

In the same way as the "testcase_total" document, the "versions_total" document contains the statistical values for each Entity Class.

Finally, the validation tests of the statistics can be found in testcases_comparison and versions-comparison. It contains the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whitney tests for all comparisons of time, power and consumption.

#### Img folder
#### Img folder
The img folder contains the graphs of the overall consumption in the execution of each measurement performed. It also includes the box plots of each device for each test case and for each version of PLT.

## Sample Logs Folder
This folder contains an example of a log, to illustrate the raw data generated by the EET measurement instrument. 
- The json file contains the measurement information of the entity class.
- Each line of 3RunC7_847_EX are the values obtained for id, time, monitor and DUT
- Each line of 3RunC7_847_IN are the values obtained for id, time, HDD(),HDD(2), Graphics card(1), Graphics card(2),Processor(1) and Processor(2).
DUT hardware components have two values because they have two sensors connected, the result of the DUT hardware component is the sum of the two values.

Note: The rest of the logs of this study are not included in the repository for practical reasons, due to their large size.
